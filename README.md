**C++17 multidimensional array (tensor) library.**

**This project is WIP!**

I wrote this library to make my numerical codes easier to write in CUDA/C++.

It provides tensor data structures, completely recursively defined, and of various layouts as to work in parallel with CBLAS, cuBLAS, LAPACK, etc.

What sets this library apart from other tensor libraries is twofold:
- Total control over data layout and what is and isn't compile time.
- No math.

I have written and rewritten this library many times to make it as elegant as possible, but implementation stays complex and difficult because it can't not be. The syntax however is elegant.



## Types

### Static

Compile time size, direct storage (stack). (`std::array` equivalent.)

```C++
Static::Array<int[3][4][5]> A;
```

For regular dense tensors, stores a C-style array of lower order tensors.

```C++
Static::Array<int[3][4]> C = A(4);
```

### Hybrid

Compile time size, heap storage. (`new std::array` equivalent.)

```C++
Hybrid::Array<int[2][3]> A {{1, 2}, {3}, {5, 6}};
```

Allocation uses `malloc` over `new` due to need for future consistency with CUDA allocation once implemented.

### Dynamic

Run time size. Compile time order. (`new type[size]` equivalent.)
(Trying to change this to make the order implicit based on number of constructor arguments. Might be impossible.)

```C++
Dynamic::Array<int[3]> A {3840, 3840, 3};
```

Dimensions are stored on stack in the object, not with the rest of the data.

Allocation uses `malloc` over `new` due to need for future consistency with CUDA allocation once implemented.

## Property System

Properties are templated. They can be given in any order. All have implicit defaults.

```C++
Static:Array<int[3]> A;
Static:Array<int[3], Layout<conventional>> B;
Static:Array<Layout<conventional>, int[3]> C;
// all the same because order doesn't matter and 'Layout' is 'conventional' by default
```



## Access

### Indexing

Elements are accessed by Fortran-style indexing (except 0-based).

```C++
Static::Tensor<float[3][4]> A;
A(0, 1) = 3;
```

If the 'wrong' number indices is given, it will correctly interpret this and return for example the beginning of a column, independent of the particular layout.

```C++
A(3);
// points to 4th column, not 4th element, i.e. A(3) == A(0, 3), not A(3) == A(3, 0)
```

### Dimensions

The square bracket operator is used to get dimensions.

```C++
Hybrid:Array<int[3][4][5]> A;
A[1]; // 4
```

For dynamic tensors the dimension can be set also (i.e. reinterpreted).
It's designed to be used like this, but there is no safety; it will never reallocate.

```C++
Dynamic::Array<int[3]> A {16, 16, 3};
A[0] = 4;
A[1] = 6;
A[2] = 24;
// works fine since 4 * 6 * 24 <= 16 * 16 * 3
```

### Pointer

In the spirit of working in parallel with other libraries, a raw pointer can easily be returned. It can however not be set.

```C++
Dynamic::Array<double[2]> A {64, 64};
A(); // raw pointer
```
(In the future it will be possible to set the pointer as well, but I need to look at some examples first where this is useful and from those examples deduce good functionality.)



## Axis

Currently only column major storage is supported, and is implicit.

```C++
Dynamic::Array<float[1000][1000], Axis<column>> A;
```



## Layouts

The goal is to ultimately support all tensor layouts by major linear algebra libraries.

### Conventional

The implicit, standard, dense layout.

```C++
Dynamic::Array<float[3], Layout<conventional>> A {3, 4, 5}; // size 60
```

### Packed

Packed storage, used in e.g. Hermitian matrices and triangular matrices. Only defined for symmetric storage.

*Partially implemented; size is correct and generalized to any number of dimensions, indexing is incomplete.*

```C++
Dynamic::Array<float[3], Layout<packed>> A {3}; // size 10
```

## Initializer Lists

Initializer lists are used not only for initialization, but also for assignment.

```C++
Hybrid::Array<int[2][2][2]> A {{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, {{5, 6}, {7, 8}}};
A(1, 1) = {-1, -2};
```

It's possible to make `constexpr` tensors in this way.

```C++
constexpr Static::Array<int[2][2]> B {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
```
