//  Properties for the Array template are mostly given as templated types. These templates sometimes hold enum values, sometimes
//  types of their own. Sometimes the properties aren't directly given as a type (e.g. the shape).
//  The property classes with their templated specific property must hold this specific property as a field for accessibility.
//  Properties are given a base type they inherit from. This way different specific properties of the same property
//  (e.g. Layout<conventional> and Layout<packed_inc>) can both be interpreted as being of the same property (e.g. Layout).



//  Shape property is special and only needs a base to distinguish it from other properties.

//  The data layout, e.g. conventional for general matrices and packed for symmetric matrices. Layout does not refer to matrix
//  type, e.g. symmetric and square triangular matrices both have a packed layout. The packed_inc type is for packed storage
//  with an increasing number of elements per section, and packed_dec for decreasing. They're effectively the same, only the
//  indexing is different. The former is used for e.g. upper triangular storage for column major matrices, but also lower
//  triangular storage for row major matrices.
